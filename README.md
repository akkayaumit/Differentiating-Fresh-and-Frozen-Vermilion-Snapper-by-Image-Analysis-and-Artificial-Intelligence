# A Comparative Study on Differentiating Fresh and Frozen-Thawed Vermilion Snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) by Image Analysis and Artificial Intelligence

Color, as an essential visual quality characteristic of fish that determines consumer preferences and purchasing decisions, provides a quick indication of its freshness. However, determining whether fish has undergone previous freezing poses a challenge. Traditional methods such as sensory evaluation, physicochemical, biochemical, and microbiological analyses, despite being time-consuming and costly, have been employed for this purpose among various fish species. This study aims to differentiate between frozen-thawed (at -20°C and at -60°C), and fresh fish samples through image analysis and artificial intelligence. A dataset comprising frozen-thawed and fresh Vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) images was used to extract features with a pre-trained deep neural network model, followed by a neural network for classification.  In addition to image analysis, we also used the same neural network classifier to learn the  the average L*, a*, b* color values extracted from the images for comparison. It is observed from the study that classification with the features extracted by the proposed artificial intelligence techniques outperforms the classification obtained by traditional L*, a*, b* color values.
